"Forbidden Island" character generator


This is a very basic (html and php) character generator for the fantastic board game "Forbidden Island" (http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&page=game&show=245)

It is very simple: pop these on a webserver, and browser to index.html. Enter the name of your players, and it will assign a character to each.
